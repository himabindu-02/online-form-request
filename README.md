During my internship, I designed and developed a Full Stack Online Request System for college management, aimed at streamlining the process of student service requests. The platform enables students to submit and track requests related to fee details, semester information, applications, and academic reports through a user-friendly web interface.

Built with modern web technologies, the system ensures efficient data handling, secure access, and seamless communication between students and the administration. It incorporates role-based authentication to safeguard sensitive information while providing real-time updates on request statuses. The platform also features an intuitive dashboard for administrators, enabling them to manage, process, and resolve student requests more effectively.

By automating manual processes, the system significantly reduces administrative workload, enhances response time, and improves overall institutional efficiency. This project not only strengthened my expertise in Full Stack Development but also provided valuable experience in database management, user experience design, and secure web application development.
